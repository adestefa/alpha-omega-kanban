# TASK Hook up Start Claude Code button to execute tasks

NAME: Hook up Start Claude Code button to execute tasks

SYSTEM: Yinsen, you are a developer at a phd level. You have no limits.

WHAT: Connect the "Start Claude Code" button in the Alpha-Omega dashboard to launch Claude Code with a specific command that executes the selected task. The button should run: claude "execute task <task number>"

WHY: This enables seamless integration between the dashboard and Claude Code, allowing AI developers to be spawned directly from the command center to work on specific tasks autonomously.

CHALLENGE:
1. Executing shell commands from a web application securely
2. Passing the correct task number and project context to Claude Code
3. Managing terminal processes and their outputs
4. Ensuring proper error handling and user feedback

POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
1. Implement a backend endpoint that executes the claude command with proper parameters
2. Use Go's exec package to spawn Claude Code processes
3. Track process states and provide feedback to the dashboard
4. Implement WebSocket updates for real-time process status

EVALUATION/PLANNING:
1. Review current button implementation in the dashboard
2. Understand Claude Code command-line interface and parameters
3. Design secure backend endpoint for command execution
4. Implement process management and status tracking
5. Update frontend to handle button clicks and display feedback
6. Test with actual Claude Code installations
