Yinsen, please find the below tasks we will work on togther. You will first help me create the full task stories from the list below.
1. Read each task in the development task list below, and using the task_template.md as a template create a story for each task in the list. Do the same for any defects listed, or skip them. Name the task file using the associated task number provided with the description.
2. Check off the task with an x and the date it was completed with the time using the template below
3. Increment the version number shown on the site.
4. All stories and defects listed below should have associated stories in 1_queue folder.
5. Only those completed should have an x and date. 
6. Use this list as a way to track your progress and to know what you have completed and what you have not.
7. Update the project history.md file with task number completed to reflect the changes you have made.
8. Before you begin a task, check for any defects. If there are defects, complete them first.
9. STOP. Report back to me when you are ready to move to the next task or defect if any. 

** Each defect should have an defect_#.md and each task should have a task_#.md file in the 1_queue folder.**
** as we complete each we move to 2_dev folder and then to 3_qa folder.**
** then we mark them with an x below when they reach 3_qa folder. **
** AFTER EACH UPDATE INCREMENT THE VERSION NUMBER IN THE MASTHEAD!! Legal Document Automation v2.5.0**

** I updated start.sh to start the latest version of the app. use this and ./stop.sh to stop the app.**
** IMPORTANT!!! Before each session, after you have hydradted your memories, take a zip of the proj-mallon folder /Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/RELEASES/pro-mallon_YYYY-MM-DD_vX.X.X.zip and save with the date and current version. This will backup the app for you before you start making changes. Only do this once per session, unless asked explicitly to do so.**

!!! START WITH DEFECTS FIRST !!!
