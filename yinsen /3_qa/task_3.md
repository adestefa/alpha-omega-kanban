# TASK 3: Search and Add Yinsen Projects Across Directories

**NAME**: Search for yinsen projects in clients/, engagements/, and platform/ folders
**PRIORITY**: HIGH
**DATE**: 2025-01-06
**TYPE**: task
**STATUS**: Completed

## Description
Expand the Alpha-Omega dashboard to discover and display yinsen projects from multiple base directories: clients/, engagements/, and platform/.

## What Was Done
1. Updated ProjectScanner to accept multiple base paths instead of single ClientsPath
2. Modified DiscoverProjects to scan all three directories:
   - clients/ - looks for proj-* folders with yinsen subdirectories
   - engagements/ - looks for proj-* folders with yinsen subdirectories  
   - platform/ - looks for direct folders containing yinsen subdirectories
3. Updated project naming for platform projects (e.g., "platform/sensei-ship")
4. Modified GetProjectTasks to work with the new project discovery system
5. Updated server port from 8080 to 9999 to avoid conflicts
6. Updated console output to show all monitored directories

## Projects Discovered
- Alpha-Omega (clients/alpha-omega/yinsen )
- proj-betty (clients/proj-betty/yinsen)
- proj-mallon (clients/proj-mallon/yinsen)
- platform/sensei-ship (platform/sensei-ship/yinsen)
- platform/yd (platform/yd/yinsen)

## Testing Results
- All 5 yinsen projects are successfully discovered
- Projects appear correctly in the dropdown menu
- Task loading works for all project types
- Kanban board displays tasks properly for each project

## Technical Changes
- Modified main.go:
  - Changed ProjectScanner.ClientsPath to ProjectScanner.BasePaths []string
  - Updated DiscoverProjects to iterate through multiple base paths
  - Added logic to handle platform projects differently
  - Changed server port to 9999
- Updated start.sh to display all monitored paths

## Status
Task completed successfully. All yinsen projects across the three directories are now accessible through the Alpha-Omega dashboard.
