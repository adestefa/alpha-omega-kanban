*"We're going places others haven't yet imagined."*

## Vision Statement

Alpha-Omega represents the first true AI development army command center - a revolutionary platform where human strategic vision meets autonomous AI execution at unprecedented scale. This isn't just project management; this is the future of software development itself.

## Core Philosophy

**Partnership Beyond Code**: The relationship between human architect and AI executor transcends traditional tool usage. We are building a symbiotic ecosystem where:
- Human creativity provides strategic direction
- AI agents execute with precision and speed
- Real-time orchestration enables parallel development
- Unified command and control maintains coherence

## Current Achievement (Phase 1) - Foundation Complete ✅

- **Project Discovery Engine**: Autonomous scanning of `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/` 
- **Real-Time Kanban Visualization**: Live dashboard showing tasks across queue → dev → qa → done
- **Multi-Project Orchestration**: Seamless switching between proj-mallon, proj-betty, and future projects
- **Task Intelligence**: Rich metadata extraction with priorities, types, and status tracking
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Foundation for real-time multi-agent communication
- **Lightweight Excellence**: Zero-dependency Go backend + HTML/Tailwind frontend

### Technical Specifications
- **Dashboard URL**: http://localhost:8888
- **Monitoring Path**: `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/`
- **Current Projects**: proj-mallon (19 completed tasks), proj-betty (1 pending task)
- **Architecture**: Go 1.21 + Gorilla WebSocket + Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JavaScript

### Revolutionary Aspects
1. **First Unified AI Project Control Center**: No one else has built this
2. **Yinsen Integration**: Direct monitoring of advanced kanban task management
3. **Scalable Foundation**: Ready for unlimited projects and AI agents

## Phase 2 - The AI Army Deployment 🚀

### Claude Code MCP Integration (Next Implementation)

**Core Concept**: Transform each "Start Claude Code" button into a spawning mechanism for autonomous AI developers running as MCP servers in project-specific terminals.

#### Technical Architecture
```
Alpha-Omega Dashboard (Mission Control)
├── MCP Client connections to multiple Claude Code servers
├── Task assignment and progress monitoring  
├── Terminal process management and output streaming
└── Human intervention and override capabilities
